I gave into temptation (again) and bought one of my favorite keycap sets... and then a board to match.

## GMK Metropolis

![GMK Metropolis R2 base kit render](./images/2024-08-24_metropolis_base.jpg)

I love GMK Metropolis[^metropolis_gb].  
I like the colors and how it uses more than one color for accents.
The set had been on my wish list for quite some time.

![GMK Metropolis R2 Turnpike kit render](./images/2024-08-24_metropolis_turnpike.jpg)

I especially like the Turnpike kit.
I'm a sucker for non-standard legends.
The regular insert, delete, ... cluster looks a bit crowded or uses abbreviations like "Pg"; and the caps lock legend does not make sense when you bind the key to another command (backspace).

The Signs novelties kit is almost too good to pass up on.
The keycaps look great with the bold colors and the symbols.
With the Turnpike kit alone, you'd lose the bold accents or you'd have to use the accents from the base kit – without the symbols.

Spacebars kits are pretty "wasteful".
You buy a bunch of spacebars only to the get the one you want – in the right size or color.
That said, the Metropolis accent colors look great...

![GMK Metropolis R2 Midnight kit render](./images/2024-08-24_metropolis_base.jpg)

Ooh, the alternate base kit just two colors looks amazing, too!
And it also has some of the nice symbols...

Once I saw a sale, I gave into temptation...  

I bought the Midnight base kit (119 Euros) together with the Turnpike kit (69 Euros).
That way, I could get either the look of the Midnight kit or use the Turnpike set to get the improved look of the regular base kit.
There was one additional benefit that would let me "justify" that purchase:
for GMK Stealth I bought a child kit with alternate alphas; so with a second overpriced child kit with alternate modifiers I could create a third set of keycaps.
I thought the gray alphas of the GMK Stealth base kit would work well with either the Midnight or Turnpike modifiers.

Then the next sale came and I added the Signs kit (32 Euros) and the Blocks kit (19 Euros) to my collection.
In total, I paid 239 Euros for Metropolis.
Not a smart investment, but at least it would give me a lot of options and together with Stealth it would fill more than one keyboard.

## qwertykeys Neo70

|  |  |
| ---- | ---- |
| Keyboard kit | Neo70 |
| Case | Anodized, CNC machined aluminum ("Navy" blue) |
| Layout | FRL TKL |
| Typing angle | 8° |
| Plate | Aluminum |
| Mounting options | Gasket mount or gummy o-ring mount |
| Lights | – |

The Neo70[^neo70][^neo70_markerchun] is a 70% / FRL TKL keyboard from qwertykeys' Neo series of entry-level custom keyboards.
It uses a simple unibody construction with a small "blocker" for the area above the arrow keys.
It uses two PCBs/plates to make that possible: a 60% PCB/plate on the left and another 10% PCB/plate on the right.
A hole in the bottom – usually covered by a magnetic badge – allows you to push out the assembly without any tools.
You don't even have to deal with any cables when you assemble or disassemble the board: the PCB connects to the components in the case with a magnetic connector.
This makes it really quick, easy, and comfortable to build or tune the board.

One of the things I like most about the Neo70: the navy blue case color.
I selected the Neo70 specifically for GMK Metropolis.
The navy matches the Metropolis base color pretty well.

For the weight, I chose the stainless steel "mirror dusk" weight.
It fits the dark theme of Metropolis and produces some blue and yellow tones.

## SWK Catmint

The Catmint switches stood out to me in multiple video reviews of different keyboards.
So I bought some once a European shop carried them[^catmint_delta].

## The Build

At first I experimented with a plateless build.
The SWK switches have relatively large pins. As a result, they sit tight in the PCB to the point that the plate becomes optional.
This worked well – but it sounded a bit more "plasticky" than what I wanted.
So I switched to the aluminum plate.

I did not use a lot of the fancy colored keycaps and instead kept the look pretty clean with only three accent pieces.
I'm hoping that I can use more of the remaining Metropolis keycaps in the future.

A unibody case like the Neo's can produce a pretty high volume and I was afraid that the high-pitched switches on aluminum might be a bit much, so I used the PCB and case foams.

## The Bill

## The Result

Looks, feels, and sounds like a keyboard – would recommend!

The keycaps match the navy case pretty well.
The board looks as I intended – fantastic.
