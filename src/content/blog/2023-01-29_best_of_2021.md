## Tracking What Media I Consume

In 2020, I started tracking all shows/movies/books/games I consume in a simple text file.

I rate everything using a rough 5-star scale.
For the scale, I value "entertainment" and how well it captures my attention over "quality".
For example, if a movie is entertaining enough that I fully focus on the movie without browsing the web on a second screen, I might rate it 5 stars even when the movie is not perfect.
As a result, I consciously "overrate" some media but I use more of the scale.
The scale is rough in that it uses just five stars, I have not fully defined what each rating means.
This focus on my attention might not be entirely fair to all movies: I'll underrate some and overrate others.

Rough idea:

```plain
Games 2021

Books – Fiction 2021

```

Note: not everything I consumed in 2021 was released in 2021.
I will include older content in my best-of lists when I consumed it in 2021.

## Best Games 2021

I played 8 games with most of my time going into online multiplayer.

1. Call of Duty: Warzone ★★★★★
2. Spider-Man Miles Morales ★★★★★
3. Halo: Infinite ★★★★★

After a year of Warzone (150+ hours), I got into Halo multiplayer again.
A classic arena shooter with high time-to-kill was really refreshing.
I didn't much care about Halo's single-player campaign (didn't finish it), but the multi-player feels great (even if it's still lacking content).

## Best Books 2021 – Fiction

I wanted to continue reading some books for entertainment.
I went looking for series of sci-fi books.
I read 8 books: 3 x Red Rising, 3 x Star Wars, 1 x Halo, and Six of Crows.

Favorite books I read:
Red Rising 1–3.

## Best Books 2021 – Non-fiction

I read 10 non-fiction books this year.
About Kotlin, micro-frontends, sofware architecture, and more.

1. Vorgehensmuster in der Softwarearchitektur ★★★★★
2. Micro Frontends in Action ★★★★★
3. Sooner Safer Happier ★★★★
4. Staff Engineer ★★★★
5. An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management ★★★★

I think it's actually a tie between "Vorgehensmuster in der Softwarearchitektur" and "Micro Frontends in Action". Both were immediately useful at work and I keep going back to them.

## Best Movies 2021

I watched 75 movies this year.

Some of my favorites (don't judge me):

- Dune ★★★★★
- Shang-Chi ★★★★★
- Justice League – Snyder Cut ★★★★★

Big-budget superhero stuff is fun :)
Letting the director do a 4-hour cut of the movie to improve on the first version? Hell yeah!

## Best Shows 2021

My favorites this year

1. Only Murders in the Building S1 ★★★★★
2. Maid S1 ★★★★★
3. Hawkeye S1 ★★★★★
4. Shadow and Bone S1 ★★★★★
5. The Falcon and the Winter Soldier ★★★★★
6. The White Lotus S1 ★★★★
7. Big Shot S1 ★★★★
8. Superman and Lois S1 ★★★★
9. Cobra Kai S3 ★★★★
10. Alice in Borderland S1 ★★★★
