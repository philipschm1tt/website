## Tracking What Media I Consume

In 2020, I started tracking all shows/movies/books/games I consume in a simple text file.

I rate everything using a rough 5-star scale.
For the scale, I value "entertainment" and how well it captures my attention over "quality".
For example, if a movie is entertaining enough that I fully focus on the movie without browsing the web on a second screen, I might rate it 5 stars even when the movie is not perfect.
As a result, I consciously "overrate" some media but I use more of the scale.
The scale is rough in that it uses just five stars, I have not fully defined what each rating means.
This focus on my attention might not be entirely fair to all movies: I'll underrate some and overrate others.

Rough idea:

```plain
Games 2023
★★★★★ Gets me hooked; I play it frequently; also during the week; I choose it over TV
★★★★ Good to great game that does not get me hooked; might not value my time enough

```

Note: not everything I consumed in 2023 was released in 2023.
I will include older content in my best-of lists when I consumed it in 2023.

## Best Games 2023

I played a mere 6 games.
After one year focused on Call of Duty Warzone and one year of Halo and Forza Horizon, I focused on single-player games in 2023. I finished two long (~80+ hours) strategy RPGs and three action adventures/RPGs.

1. Jedi: Survivor ★★★★★ – I loved the gameplay and the universe
2. Marvel's Midnight Suns ★★★★ – Great game from the X-Com team with too much padding; dragged in the end
3. God of War: Ragnarök ★★★★ – Fantastic story/graphics/set piece moments; but I don't fully love the gameplay
4. Fire Emblem Engage ★★★★ – I always like Fire Emblem

Not finished yet:
Hogwarts Legacy ★★★★–★★★★★★

Need to pick up again:
Cyberpunk 2077.
I started playing it in my summer vacation but then stopped – who has time for these massive, long games? I want to pick it up again with the new updates and the story add-on.

Best games I haven't played:

- Jagged Alliance 3 – Jagged Alliance 2 is one of my all-time favorite games
- Baldur's Gate 3

Either of them could be my "Game of the Year" but I didn't want to start those long games yet.
Meanwhile, I'll wait for some patches and play some shorter games.

## Best Books 2023 – Fiction

I read a grand total of zero fiction books.
After getting back into reading more books in 2021 (8 sci-fic books), I fell back to zero.
I should pick that up again some time.

## Best Books 2023 – Non-fiction

I read only 6 non-fiction books this year.

1. Architecture Modernization ★★★★★
2. Wardley Mapping (chapters 1–19) ★★★★
3. Building a Second Brain ★★★★★
4. How to Decide ★★★★
5. Observability Engineering ★★★★
6. The Crux ★★★★

Architecture Modernization by Nick Tune is my Book of the Year.
When I work through non-fiction books, I tend to highlight the most important parts of the text.
For this book, I highlighted so much of the book that my notes barely count as a "summary".
It's directly applicable to my job.

## Best Movies 2023

I watched 68 movies this year; only 4 of them "at the movies".

My top 5 movies in the order that I watched them:

- Bullet Train ★★★★★ – Unexpectedly good; really fun movie
- John Wick 4 ★★★★★ – Oh my god – that "Hotline Miami" scene!
- The Menu ★★★★★ – Went into it blind and could not look away
- Guardians of the Galaxy 3 ★★★★★ – Great ending to a great trilogy
- Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part 1 ★★★★★ – With their focus on stunts over CGI, MI always stands out

## Best Shows 2023

I watched an absolutely shameful amount of television this year: 100+ seasons :)
I could probably spend my time better and do more productive things.

Part of the reason why I watched more TV this year may be that no games got me really hooked where I would pick games over shows.

Best shows this year – roughly ordered without overthinking it:

1. The Bear S2 ★★★★★ – Who knew a show about running a restaurant could be that good...
2. Ted Lasso S3 ★★★★★ – I also don't care about soccer but I'd love to spend more time with these characters
3. The Night Agent ★★★★★ – One of the surprise hits of the year; pretty simple action plot but fun
4. The Diplomat ★★★★★ – The best "woman does diplomacy" since Madam Secretary ;)
5. Shrinking S1 ★★★★★ – Good combination of fun and emotional with a delightful lack of soccer.
6. The Last of Us S1 ★★★★★ – Contender for best video game adaptation ever
7. Midnight Mass ★★★★★ – I'm generally not big on horror but after finally watching Midnight Mass and going in blind, I immediately watched three other Flanagan shows (both Hauntings and Usher)
8. Marvelous Mrs. Maisel S5 ★★★★★ – It's always great when long-running shows really stick the landing
9. Loki S2 ★★★★★ – Time travel is always fun. Season started slow but the finale elevated it into my top 10
10. Jury Duty ★★★★★ – I don't watch a lot of unscripted shows and don't care much about "mockumentaries" but after a few episodes I was hooked; great concept!

Honorable mentions:

- Ahsoka S1 ★★★★★
- Blue Eye Samurai S1 ★★★★★
- The Fall of the House of Usher ★★★★★
- Generation V S1 ★★★★★
- Domina S2 ★★★★★
- For All Mankind S2 ★★★★★
- You S4 ★★★★★
- Sex Education S4 ★★★★★
- Lessons in Chemistry ★★★★★
- The Haunting of Hill House ★★★★★
- The Lost Flowers of Alice Hart ★★★★★
- Fleishman is in Trouble ★★★★★

Best episodes of the year:

1. The Bear S2 E7 – Forks (9.7/10 on [imdb](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14452776/episodes/?season=2) with 12k ratings)
2. Loki S2 E6 – Glorious Purpose (9.5/10 on [imdb](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9140554/episodes/?season=2) with 23k ratings)
3. Marvelous Mrs. Maisel S5 E9 – Four Minutes (9.5/10 on [imdb](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5788792/episodes/?season=5) with 3.6k ratings)

When a full episode focuses on a side story of a character you don't care for / dislike, in which he polishes forks for a week and sings to Taylor Swift in his car... and then you go "Best episode of the year"...

The Loki finale elevated the whole season. Probably the best Marvel content since Endgame.

## The Raw Data

It's best you stop reading here (or don't judge me).
