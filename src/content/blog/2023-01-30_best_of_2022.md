## Tracking What Media I Consume

In 2020, I started tracking all shows/movies/books/games I consume in a simple text file.

I rate everything using a rough 5-star scale.
For the scale, I value "entertainment" and how well it captures my attention over "quality".
For example, if a movie is entertaining enough that I fully focus on the movie without browsing the web on a second screen, I might rate it 5 stars even when the movie is not perfect.
As a result, I consciously "overrate" some media but I use more of the scale.
The scale is rough in that it uses just five stars, I have not fully defined what each rating means.
This focus on my attention might not be entirely fair to all movies: I'll underrate some and overrate others.

Rough idea:

Note: not everything I consumed in 2022 was released in 2022.
I will include older content in my best-of lists when I consumed it in 2022.
