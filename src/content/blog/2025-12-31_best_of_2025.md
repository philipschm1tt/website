## Tracking What Media I Consume

In 2020, I started tracking all shows/movies/books/games I consume in a simple text file.

I rate everything using a rough 5-star scale.
For the scale, I value "entertainment" and how well it captures my attention over "quality".
For example, if a movie is entertaining enough that I fully focus on the movie without browsing the web on a second screen, I might rate it 5 stars even when the movie is not perfect.
As a result, I consciously "overrate" some media but I use more of the scale.
The scale is rough in that it uses just five stars, I have not fully defined what each rating means.
This focus on my attention might not be entirely fair to all movies: I'll underrate some and overrate others.

Rough idea:

```plain
Games 2025
★★★★★ Gets me hooked; I play it frequently; also during the week; I choose it over TV
★★★★ Good to great game that does not get me hooked; might not value my time enough

Note: not everything I consumed in 2025 was released in 2025.
I will include older content in my best-of lists when I consumed it in 2025.

## Best Games 2025

I played quite a few games this year – mainly local multiplayer.

I was not motivated to play any single player games. It took me half a year to finish Indiana Jones; then I played Jagged Alliance 3 and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 but didn't get far in either of them. I considered a bunch of other games that I could access as part of the Game Pass but I wasn't feeling it this year.

The reason I played few single player games might be that I played a lot of local multiplayer games this year and playing the single-player games I tried felt a bit lonely in comparison.

1. Boomerang Fu ★★★★★ – Highly replayable with up to six players; always fun.
2. Tricky Tower ★★★★★ – Funnest take on Tetris since the Gameboy version.
3. Split Fiction ★★★★★ (unfinished) – My favorite two-player coop game this year.
4. Mario Kart Deluxe 8 ★★★★★ – I probably played more Mario Kart this year than any other games (across N64, Gamecube, Wii, Switch, Switch 2); most of the time went into Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.
5. It Takes Two ★★★★+ – I finally found out why this game did well in the Game of the Year awards in 2021.

## Best Books 2025 – Fiction

I barely read any fiction this year.

1. Murderbot 2: Artificial Condition ★★★★
2. The Name of the Wind (partial) ★★★

The Name of the Wind didn't grip me and I put it on hold for most of the year.
I read one Murderbot book and enjoyed it – but I didn't directly jump to the next one.
Still waiting for the final book in the Red Rising series.

## Best Books 2025 – Non-fiction

I didn't read a lot of non-fiction, either.
I spent some time in the self-help section this year...

1. Anatomy of E-commerce Search ★★★★+ – Good overview on ecommerce search with some insights I can apply at work.
2. The Brain at Rest ★★★★ – Supposedly, doing nothing is pretty good.
3. Captivate ★★★★ – Some good lessons I don't apply.
4. Cues ★★★ – More good lessons I don't apply.

## Best Movies 2025

I watched 47 movies this year; only two of them "at the movies".

My top 5 movies in the order that I watched them:

- The Gorge ★★★★★ – Biggest surprise this year; fun setting, visuals, and action.
- Mission Impossible: Final Reckoning (at the movies) ★★★★★ – Best set pieces.
- Thunderbolts* ★★★★★- – Good Marvel movie.
- Avatar: Fire & Ash (at the movies, en, 3D HFR) ★★★★★ – Impressive visuals; entertaining enough to pay attention for more than three hours.
- F1 ★★★★★- – Fun sports movie with good visuals and soundtrack.

## Best Shows 2025

Best shows this year – roughly ordered without overthinking it:

1. The Pitt S1 ★★★★★ – I loved the 24-style setup with all episodes taking place on one day; with a couple of really strong episodes.
2. Invincible S3 ★★★★★ – Some of the best action that is only really possible in an animated show.
3. Cobra Kai S6 ★★★★★ – Good conclusion of the series.
4. Paradise ★★★★★ – Surprise hit of the year; most enjoyable if you go in blind.
5. Ghosts S4 ★★★★★ – Consistently great comedy.
6. The Bear S4 ★★★★★ – As always, the season had one or two standout episodes.
7. The Sandman S2 ★★★★★ – Not as good as the first season but still great.
8. The Last of Us S2 ★★★★★ – This will be a long wait until they finish the entire story of the game.
9. Hacks S3 ★★★★★- – Season 3 was Hacks at its best; good plot.
10. Gen V S2 ★★★★★- – I binged this pretty quickly.

Honorable mentions:

- The Diplomat S3 ★★★★★-
- Peacemaker S2 ★★★★★-
- Wednesday S2 ★★★★★-
- On Call ★★★★★-
- American Primeval ★★★★★-
- The Night Agent S2 ★★★★★-
- The Recruit S2 ★★★★★-
- DareDevil: Born Again S1 ★★★★★-
