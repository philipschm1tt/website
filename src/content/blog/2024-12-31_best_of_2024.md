## Tracking What Media I Consume

In 2020, I started tracking all shows/movies/books/games I consume in a simple text file.

I rate everything using a rough 5-star scale.
For the scale, I value "entertainment" and how well it captures my attention over "quality".
For example, if a movie is entertaining enough that I fully focus on the movie without browsing the web on a second screen, I might rate it 5 stars even when the movie is not perfect.
As a result, I consciously "overrate" some media but I use more of the scale.
The scale is rough in that it uses just five stars, I have not fully defined what each rating means.
This focus on my attention might not be entirely fair to all movies: I'll underrate some and overrate others.

Rough idea:

```plain
Games 2024
★★★★★ Gets me hooked; I play it frequently; also during the week; I choose it over TV
★★★★ Good to great game that does not get me hooked; might not value my time enough

Note: not everything I consumed in 2024 was released in 2024.
I will include older content in my best-of lists when I consumed it in 2024.

## Best Games 2024

I played six games this year; mostly single player games.
I finally returned to Cyberpunk 2077 (v2.1) put around 80 hours into it.
I directly jumped into Phantom Liberty and got hooked enough to finish the main story and lots of side quests.

1. Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty ★★★★★ – Great setting, story and meaningful player choices
2. Cyberpunk 2077 ★★★★★ – There is so much to do in the game and even the side quests are great.
3. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Multiplayer ★★★★★ – Great multiplayer game
4. Residen Evil 4 (Remake) ★★★★+ – Impressive remake almost 20 years after I played the original on the Gamecube
5. Hogwarts Legacy ★★★★+ – They did a great job re-creating Hogwarts
6. Hellblade 2 ★★★★ – The visuals and atmosphere are incredible at time
7. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Campaign ★★★★ – My first CoD campaign since the 2007 Modern Warfare; surprisingly varied with some good missions

## Best Books 2024 – Fiction

I completed four fiction books this year.
I mainly read books 4–6 of the Red Rising series; now I'm eagerly awaiting the final entry in the series.

1. Light Bringer ★★★★★ – Epic; the book has a 4.75 on goodreads and it deserves it
2. Dark Age ★★★★★ – As bleak and dark as it gets; imagine an extended "red wedding"
3. Iron Gold ★★★★+ – Fantastic setup for the remainder of the series
4. The Poppy War ★★★★ – Nice setting

I enjoyed the first three books in the series a lot and thought the third book, Morning Star, was a great conclusion of the trilogy. 
I had no immediate intention of reading the rest of the series but this year I picked it up again.

Iron Gold was great, but when I started Dark Age and Light Bringer I could barely stop myself.
I read most of Dark Age (~800 pages) and Light Bringer (~700 pages) in my three week summer vacation
(instead of reading some non-fiction books I had planned to start).

I am ready to proclaim Red God, the seventh and final book in the Red Rising saga, my book of the year 2025 (assuming it doesn't get delayed).

## Best Books 2024 – Non-fiction

I read a grand total of one non-fiction books this year.
I blame the Red Rising books.

1. Relevant Search ★★★★★ – Great introduction to search

## Best Movies 2024

I watched 55 movies this year; only four of them "at the movies".

My top 5 movies in the order that I watched them:

- Guardians of the Galaxy 3 ★★★★★ – Still great on my second watch (after I watched it in German at the movies last year)
- All of Us Strangers ★★★★+ – Weird in a good way; I might have to watch this again
- Dune: Part Two (at the movies) ★★★★★ – Great movie theater experience
- Spider-Man: No Way Home (extended) ★★★★+ – Still good on my second watch (first time in English; first time extended)
- Deadpool & Wolverine (at the movies, 3D) ★★★★★ – Good movie theater experience; I had a great time even if the movie is not quite "great"

## Best Shows 2024

2024 was my year of the rewatch.
I don't rewatch a lot of shows – there's always so much new stuff I want to see.
But 20 years after House premiered I decided to rewatch all 8 seasons, 176 episodes, 129h 48m of the show. And then I watched the mini series Generation Kill for the third time.
I'll exclude the shows from my 2024 list.

Best shows this year – roughly ordered without overthinking it:

1. Shogun S1 ★★★★★+ – Great setting, production, cast, ...
2. Shrinking S2 ★★★★★ – Good mix of funny and emotional with a delightful cast of characters
3. The Bear S3 ★★★★★ – Still good with some really high highs
4. Fallout S1 ★★★★★ – Turns out you can make a great video game adaptation
5. House of the Dragon S2 ★★★★★ – Who was that again? Woah, dragons!
6. The Boys S4 ★★★★★ – Bold, unhinged, always entertaining
7. The Diplomat S2 ★★★★★ – Consistently high quality
8. Nobody Wants This ★★★★★ – Easy-to-binge rom-com
9. Only Murders in the Building S4 ★★★★★ – Still delightful
10. English Teacher ★★★★★ – Funniest new comedy this year

Honorable mentions:

- Agatha All Along ★★★★★
- Ted S1 ★★★★★
- Halo S2 ★★★★★
- Industry S3 ★★★★+
- Tokyo Vice S2 ★★★★+
- For All Mankind S4 ★★★★+
- Supacell S1 ★★★★+
- The Good Doctor S7 ★★★★+
- A Man on the Inside S1 ★★★★+
- Black Doves ★★★★+

Best episodes of the year:

1. The Bear S3 E6 – Napkins (9.1/10 on [imdb](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14452776/episodes/?season=3) with 8k ratings)
2. Shrinking S2 E12 – The Last Thanksgiving (9.3/10 on [imdb](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15677150/episodes/?season=2) with 1.1k ratings)
3. Superman & Lois S4 E10 – It Went by So Fast (9.5/10 on [imdb](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11192306/episodes/?season=4) with 1.7k ratings)
4. Agatha All Along E7 – Death's Hand in Mine (9.1/10 on [imdb](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15571732/episodes/?season=2) with 15k ratings)
5. House of the Dragon S2 E4 – The Red Dragon and the Gold (9.4/10 on [imdb](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11198330/episodes/?season=2) with 58k ratings)
6. House of the Dragon S2 E7 – The Red Sowing (8.8/10 on [imdb](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11198330/episodes/?season=2) with 37k ratings)
7. The Acolyte E5 – Night (6.5/10 on [imdb](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12262202/episodes/) with 18k ratings)

I'm probably missing some really great episodes; I should probably track them better.

Best shows I rewatched this year:

- Generation Kill (3rd time) ★★★★★+
- House S1 ★★★★★
- House S2 ★★★★★
- House S3 ★★★★★
- House S4 ★★★★★+
- House S5 ★★★★★
- House S6 ★★★★★
- House S7 ★★★★★
- House S8 ★★★★★

The character House is consistently fun to watch.
Initially I wondered whether I should watch only the good episodes again.
Turns out they are all pretty good[^imdb_house]:
