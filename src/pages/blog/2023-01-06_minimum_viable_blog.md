When starting a blog as a side project, it's tempting to invest a lot of time into building the perfect blog before actually starting to write anything.
To resist that temptation, I want to start with the "minimum viable blog".
I want to set up the blog with little effort and (probably) iterate later.
In this post, I describe the least I could do to get this thing up and running :)

## Astro Blog Starter

To make it easy and painless to start building a website, frameworks like Astro commonly provide some "starter" projects – like templates for a basic blog.
Astro provides an "official" blog starter[^1] while the Astro community has added many alternatives[^2].

The official blog starter covers the basics for a blog with minimal styling[^3]:
> ✅ Minimal styling (make it your own!)  
> ✅ 100/100 Lighthouse performance  
> ✅ SEO-friendly with canonical URLs and OpenGraph data  
> ✅ Sitemap support  
> ✅ RSS Feed support  
> ✅ Markdown & MDX support

That will do.

## Step 1: Set Up the Astro Project

The projects basically sets itself up:

```
npm create astro@latest -- --template blog
Need to install the following packages:
  create-astro@1.2.1
Ok to proceed? (y) y

```

Start the page locally (at `http://localhost:3000`) with `npm run dev`.

## Step 2: Provide Imprint and Privacy Policy

To comply with European laws, you need an imprint and a privacy policy.
I used free generators and templaes and looked at other developer blogs for inspiration.

## Step 3: Host the Site With Cloudflare Pages

Setting up a website on Cloudflare Pages is simple and can be done within minutes.
You mainly point it at a GitHub project and fill in a little bit of configuration.

The Astro website describes the process in seven small steps[^3]
> 1. Set up a new project on Cloudflare Pages.
> 2. Push your code to your git repository (GitHub, GitLab).
> 3. Log in to the Cloudflare dashboard and select your account in Account Home > Pages.
> 4. Select Create a new Project and the Connect Git option.
> 5. Select the git project you want to deploy and click Begin setup
> 6. Use the following build settings:
>   - Framework preset: Astro
>   - Build command: npm run build
>   - Build output directory: dist
>   - Environment variables (advanced): By default, Cloudflare Pages uses Node.js 12.18.0, 
> but Astro requires a higher version. Add an environment variable with a Variable name of 
> NODE_VERSION and a Value of v16.13.0 or higher to tell Cloudflare to use a compatible 
> Node version. Alternatively, add a .nvmrc file to your project to specify a Node version.
> 7. Click the Save and Deploy button.

[^3]: Astro Docs [How to deploy a site with Git] (https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/cloudflare/#how-to-deploy-a-site-with-git)

Cloudflare provides its own instructions for deploying Astro Pages at [Deploy an Astro site](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/astro)

## Step 4: Use a Custom Domain

Rough steps:

1. Buy a domain at any place where domains are sold.
2. Add you domain as a "Website" in the Cloudflare dashboard
3. Configure the DNS records in the Cloudflare dashboard to point at your Cloudflare Pages website
4. Configure the Cloudflare nameservers for your domain where you bought the domain

## Step 5: Profit

Setting up a basic blog is simple and quick.
I spent the most time on imprint and privacy policy and virtually no time on the actual website.

Now it's time to write.
