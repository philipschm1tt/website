I am starting a blog.  
I _might_ irregularly publish some imperfect content that is irrelevant to most.

The looming Twitter death spiral shows that your content is not guaranteed to be durable and future-proof on other people's platforms.
So I will build the blog as a static website.
Moreover, I will use the blog as a playground for some web technologies.

So here it is – my minimum viable blog.
